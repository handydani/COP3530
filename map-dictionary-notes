Map/Dictionary: a collection of key, value pairs

ADT
insert(key, value)
remove(key)
search(key)

expected length of each chain = n/m = d = load factor
O(1 + d) = search


Hash functions:

1) h(k) = k % m // k is key, m is
2) h(k) = [(a*k)mod 2^w] >> w-r // given some key, give us a more random better distribution
            //first we have our key, random integer a, and multiply them
            //
